# SutterBus: Your Personalized Muni Bus Tracker

If you take the muni on a daily basis, it can be a hassle checking bus prediction web sites/apps for your various routes and stops to get an estimation of when your next bus will arrive. This [app](http://sutterbus.herokuapp.com) requires one time setup, where you select the bus routes and the stops that you frequently take. It will then generate a unique URL (that you can book mark or save onto your phone) that will display real time prediction data for your selected routes and stops.

## How to use

Go [here](http://sutterbus.herokuapp.com/) either on your mobile Safari or on a desk top web browser. Select the routes and the bus stops that you primarily frequent. Hit the button and a unique URL will be generated for you (so you should save this one to your home screen to easily retrieve it in the future).

## How it works

I used [NextBus's XML Feed](http://www.nextbus.com/xmlFeedDocs/NextBusXMLFeed.pdf) to get the muni predictions.
