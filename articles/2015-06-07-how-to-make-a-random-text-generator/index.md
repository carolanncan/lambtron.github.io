If you've ever written into support at Segment, you've probably received an email from one of us with a whimsical "inspirational" quote appended to the end. But how do we keep the footer quotes different each time? We use a special script with [atext](https://www.trankynam.com/atext/) in order to keep the quotes random and freshâ€”here is how we do it!

case $rand in  #BEGIN CASE
