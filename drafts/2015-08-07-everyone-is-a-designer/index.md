# Everyone is a Designer

Yes, even you. Yes, you. This past week, I had the pleasure of working with one of the designers on our team. Apparently, design is less about your Sketch skills or how particular you are about your Espresso, and more about problem solving. Here is what I learned!

If you have ever had to solve a problem, you used techniques that are commonly used by designers. Chances are that you weren't _aware_ of those techniques—divergent thinking, convergent thinking, analysis, synthesis, etc.—but you still arrived at a satisfactory solution and continued on with your life.

This post will explore the approach designers take when solving problems, assert that everybody has these skills, and encourage us to be more aware and mindful of our problem solving processes.

## Making it Pop

From the outside looking in, I've always thought designers were highly visual, strongly opinionated (from how they take their coffee to what hex of dark-blue-grey to use on a site), comfortably standoffish (hiding smugly behind thick-rimmed glasses and a beard), gregariously introspective, in a constant state of thinly-veiled self-doubt, and always two-cups-worth caffeinated.

I've never worked with designers directly. Though I've always seen the impact of their efforts in the final products, it was always a mystery how their contributions shaped them.

> What I thought designers did

For some reason, I thought designers were given "design" tasks ("make this button 'pop'") throughout various parts of the product-building process. It was only recently that I realized designers are (and, arguably, should be) involved at the beginning of that process. Even before the team decides to build the product. I'm talking about the stage so early in the product-conceiving process, when the team just knows that there is only a _problem_ that needs to be fixed.

## Problem Solving

The goal of making things is to help make our lives easier, to help us solve problems (ok, not everything—I make plenty of projects that serve zero purpose). But what use is that if we, as end users, don't ultimately use those things? Everything you use has had some thought put into its usability.

> Finally, people have to actually purchase it. It doesn’t matter how good a product is if, in the end, nobody uses it.
> Donald Norman, in [The Design of Everyday Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things)

Usability _is_ design. Thinking about how someone uses the thing requires thinking about its design. Somebody had to empathize with end users and understand the their needs, values, wants, etc., in order to design something useful and easy to use for them.

Since the thing is the _solution_ to the problem, the initial conception of the thing revolves around _understanding_ the problem. And designers are the ones at the tip of the spear for this, because they contribute to the ultimate usasbility of the final thing.

Though everyone goes through a problem solving process (often unaware), designers are meticulous and "meta-aware" of these mechanisms. They employ a deconstructed, rigorous problem solving process as an approach to generating solutions. We'll go through some examples with this approach and identify the skills being used to demonstrate that we are all capable of leveraging them in our day to day lives.

## Understanding the problem

In order to come up with the solution, we need to understand the problem from all angles. This seems obvious, but we'll see why this is also often the most undervalued part of the problem solving process. We'll also see why spending enough time to thoroughly dig into this phase will help make the rest of the process easier.

When you are thinking about what to eat for dinner, understanding the problem can be straight forward:
- I am hungry

Though sometimes understanding the problem can lead to unexpected results:
- I want something tasty
- why?
- i want to feel good

This is where you ask all the 'why' questions. You want to understand the problem so deeply.

## Brainstorming all solutions

Addressing the big problems from earlier helps to come up with solutions.

When you are thinking about what to eat for dinner, you probably spend some time on this:
- eat in or dine out?
- DoorDash, SpoonRocket, Munchery, PostMates, ..., or die of starvation?
- Primal-Paleo diet, Piscaterian-Cyclical-Ketogenic diet, or 20 McDonalds McNuggets?

This process is something designers like to call "divergent thinking", where we 



## Choosing a sensible solution

then, we figure out what solution is best. chances are, if we look at all of the problems, the solution is obvious.

## Designing your life



i got a chance to work with design. i loved it bceause why?

design is a meta awareness. meta learning. meta meta meta.

understanding the problem. solving the problem.

everyone is a designer. everyone solves problems.

what are design skills?

asking questions. asking why?

'what is the premise of that concern?'

global maxima. how do we get there?
