</style><p><a href="https://www.producthunt.com">Product Hunt</a> has become the de facto way to launch and grow your business. I&#x2019;ve recently had the unique opportunity to have something featured on Product Hunt. Let&#x2019;s take a look at the traffic numbers behind the fabled &#x201C;Product Hunt&#x201D; effect.</p>
<p>On June 20th, 2015, I launched <a href="http://www.producthunt.com/posts/bottom-of-product-hunt">BottomOfProductHunt</a> on Product Hunt.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bottomofproducthunt.com">BottomOfProductHunt</a> is a single purpose, zero-value-add website that only shows posts on Product Hunt beneath a certain score. It was built as a fun side project, primarily to troll <a href="https://twitter.com/dirtyanalytics">my friend</a>, who is the project&#x2019;s inspiration and muse. As such, I had zero (arguably, negative) expectations about how this site would perform post-Product Hunt launch. Knowing the quirks of Silicon Valley, however, it also would not be out of the question if something like this ends up raising a round of financing, or whatever.</p>
<p>Like any data-minded, analytics-driven troll, I wanted to measure <em>just</em> the extent of my half-baked efforts. I added <a href="https://www.segment.com">Segment</a>&#x2018;s analytics.js snippet to the page and turned on <a href="https://analytics.google.com">Google Analytics</a>. Since this was essentially a static site, I did not map out any &#x201C;events&#x201D; that I wanted to track, so the js snippet alone was enough to track page views.</p>
<h2 id="do-you-even-lift-bro-">Do you even lift, bro?</h2>
<p>Here is a screenshot of the Google Analytics session report. For those of you sane enough to not get into the analytics business, a <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2731565?hl=en">&#x201C;session&#x201D;</a> is defined as a group of interactions that take place on your website within a given time frame. In our special case, it just means someone looking at the website.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/yT1JvmC.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The first day of being on Product Hunt gave it a whopping 403 sessions, which is 401 more sessions than expected (one from me and one from <a href="https://twitter.com/dirtyanalytics">@DirtyAnalytics</a>). At an average duration session of 21 seconds, that is ~141 collective minutes of human kind that cannot be returned <a href="http://media.giphy.com/media/rd4PovI7PgYw0/giphy.gif">#sorrynotsorry<img src="http://media.giphy.com/media/rd4PovI7PgYw0/giphy.gif"></a>.</p>
<p>Also, even after Product Hunt fanfare settled, I did not expect sustained traffic, or &#x201C;lift&#x201D;. There are still daily consistent 20-50 sessions on the site. Though I suspect this is largely from robots, I will certainly keep an eye on this for the next few months, before I begin putting together my pitch deck and approaching reputable VCs.</p>
<p>Being the scrappy growth hacker that I am, I decided to move my mouse cursor further down in the Google Analytics interface and click on &#x201C;Acquisition&#x201D; to learn more about where all of this undeserved traffic came from.</p>
<h2 id="referrer-madness">Referrer Madness</h2>
<p>Here is a screenshot of the GA Acquisition &gt; All Traffic &gt; Source/Medium report.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/YiQmOYH.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Again, for those smart enough to avoid the analytics industry, a &#x201C;referrer&#x201D; is the URL of the previous webpage from which the link was followed. This is automatically done by HTTP requests (in the header), but used widely by analytics tools.</p>
<p>Obviously, the largest bulk of the traffic came from <a href="https://www.producthunt.com">producthunt.com</a> as a referrer. The second majority is &#x201C;direct&#x201D;, meaning that people visited the site directly in their browser, which actually means that they clicked on a link sent from other people, who have achieved the &#x201C;a-ha&#x201D; moment from being on the bottomofproducthunt.com site and wanted to share it to their closest enemies as a way to derail their unwavering focus with additional meaningless noise.</p>
<p>All of the other referral sources are from the organic, human, certainly not robots &#x201C;more-free-traffic&#x201D; domains. It may be considered <a href="https://forums.digitalpoint.com/threads/fake-referral-traffic.2750838/">referral</a> <a href="http://viget.com/advance/removing-referral-spam-from-google-analytics">spam</a> to some, but it is this kind of mini affirmation that gets me out of bed in the mornings.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://www.get-free-traffic-now.com/">one</a> is particularly amusing:</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/K2E69zv.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Another unusual one is actually <a href="http://event-tracking.com/">event-tracking.com</a>. I thought it would be another robot one, but it actually is a guide to using Google Analytics analytics.js library to send events. Good on you for being helpful.</p>
<p>Aside from the robots, I see a few <a href="http://feedly.com/">feedly</a> users, <a href="http://thenews.im/">thenews.im</a> users, <a href="https://www.pulse.me/">pulse.me</a> users, <a href="http://alltechnews.co/">alltechnews.co</a> users, and <a href="http://losthunts.com/">Lost Hunts</a> users (Bottom of Product Hunt is pretty much a shittier, less-inspired clone of this one). Also a few referrers from Twitter (via this link, <a href="http://t.co/kol9fbT9JJ">http://t.co/kol9fbT9JJ</a>; unfortunately, Twitter won&#x2019;t show me what the original tweet is, but I&#x2019;m guessing it&#x2019;s <a href="https://twitter.com/ProductHunt/status/612404808109174784">this one</a>). <a href="http://media.giphy.com/media/kViTiGaoqD0gU/giphy.gif">Yay, social<img src="http://media.giphy.com/media/kViTiGaoqD0gU/giphy.gif"></a>!</p>
<p>Some domains I did not recognize are <a href="http://revery.io/">revery.io</a> (&#x201C;updates from all your favorite sites&#x201D;, still in beta testing), <a href="http://www.jianshu.com/">jianshu.com</a> (looks like a Chinese news aggregator), and <a href="http://www.netvibes.com/en">netvibes.com</a> (&#x201C;a dashboard for everything&#x201D;, including probably news stories).</p>
<p>There is also one poor soul who came to the site from a Google search. I wonder what stray Google query led to that?</p>
<h2 id="what-s-next-">What&#x2019;s next?</h2>
<p>Probably nothing. Unless someone pokes me to do something about this site, it&#x2019;ll most likely end up lost in some dark corner of the web, where it&#x2019;ll find a highly devoted niche following in some random community. But I&#x2019;ll continue to invest in renewing the domain, just in case some astute, enterprising person wants to acquire the consistent stream of valuable bot traffic.</p>
<p>Hope this was useful for your Product Hunt launch!! If you have any questions or comments, please <a href="https://www.twitter.com/andyjiang">tweet me</a>!</p>
